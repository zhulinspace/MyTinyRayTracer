NO third party to construct Ray  Tracer

According to  *Ray Tracing in a Weekend* , but I use  window output instead of ppm outfile

## Here are my pre

1.the setup for windows 

2.add  easy math lib---glm

3.add std_image for loading or storing image

### Step By Step

1. Constructing a ray
2. Adding a sphere
3. Suface normals
4. add hitable list 
5. Antialiasing 
6. Material

7. Dielectrics ï¼ˆbug)
8. positionable camera

Next:

Now I doubt there is bug or not ,but my programs still work not good,

But most importanly , it is too SLOW(may be one evening for the complex scene)

So this recurisve Ray Tracing ,or Whitted_style Ray Tracing is not in my next plan,

I need find the faster way to do it!
